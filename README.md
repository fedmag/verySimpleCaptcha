# VerySimpleCaptcha (VSC)

Library created to be used in my personal website.
Annoyed by the amount of spambots that used the contact form on the website I decided to add the
captcha
verification before the email was actually sent.

The library build a Captcha object from a randomly generated string and provides a convenient method
to obtain the image as Base64 string.

The Captcha builder allows the user to apply customizations such as: apply image filters, font
transformations and customizations,
decide the string length and more.
